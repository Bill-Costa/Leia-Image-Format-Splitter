David LeDoux (`dclbiz@comcast.net`) provided a set of sample files
provided with the Lume Pad 2 some of which appear to be problematical.
In his email, dated 27-JUL-2023, he writes:

Hi Bill,

I tested your new mij-splitter script and it worked fine on Ubuntu
20.04 once I installed the autovivification module.  I may be wrong,
but I'm guessing you do not own a Lume Pad 2.  If that's the case, you
might like to play with the 25 files that are provided as sample
images on LP2.  I have zipped them and put them on WeTransfer for you:

Twenty of these files work fine with your script (and mine), but 5 of
them are very bizarre and will not work with either of our scripts.
The following 4 files each contain DOZENS of JPG start signatures:
Dinosaur.jpg, Pistachios.jpg, Blackberries.jpg, and Fjord.jpg.  In
addition, the file Cactus.jpg contains 6 JPG signatures, and it also
will not work with either of our scripts.

The original Lume Pad also had some strange sample files like these,
and they would not work with my script.  I assume these odd files were
not produced by LeiaCam, yet they must be valid LIF files since
LeiaPlayer can display them.  I can only conclude that the LIF format
(which Nima insists is "very simple") has some bizarre variations that
I have not been able to figure out.  (This is why I keep hounding Nima
to release a format spec.)  If you have any insight into these files,
I would be very interested.

Thanks,

David LeDoux
