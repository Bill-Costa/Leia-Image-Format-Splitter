# Sample Image Files #

The following sample files are provided by the author for testing.

**Note:** that for that the four 3D image files found here are as
exported from the camera as-is and have not been aligned.  Automatic
alignment of 3D images using stereo photo editor software is highly
recommended for comfortable viewing.
