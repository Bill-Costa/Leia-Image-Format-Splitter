# Sample Image Files #

The following sample files are provided by the author for testing.

**Note:** that for that the four 3D image files found here are as
exported from the camera as-is and have not been aligned.  Automatic
alignment of 3D images using stereo photo editor software is highly
recommended for comfortable viewing.


Image File                  | Test    | Notes
---------------------------:|:-------:|:---------------------------------------
`00-empty.jpg`              | reject  | empty file posing as a JPEG image
`01-cameraman.jpg`          | reject  | conventional JPEG image
`02-super-mario.jps`        | reject  | SBS 3D image in single file (file type)
`03-cat-stack.jpg`          | flag    | five 2D JPEGS concatenated together
`04-monticello.mpo`         | accept  | 3D image captured w/ Fujifilm W3 camera
`05-chrome-engine_RH1.jpg`  | accept  | 3D image from Red Hydrogen One phone
`06-oregano_LumePad.jpg`    | accept  | 3D image from Leia Luma Pad tablet
`07-valentines_LumePad.jpg` | accept  | 3D image from Leia Luma Pad tablet
`08-purple-bike_LumePad-v2.jpg` | accept | 3D image from V2 Leia Luma Pad
`09-flower-pots_LumePad-v2.jpg` | accept | 3D image from v2 Leia Luma Pad

Thanks to **David C. LeDoux** for images 08 & 09 which were created by
version 2 of the Leia Luma Pad.  Apparently the new Leia file format
no longer includes depthmap images.
